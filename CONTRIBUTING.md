everyone easily read, review, and understand our code. Please follow these conventions when
submitting pull requests.

### Tips for a good pull request

Pull requests can be hard to review if they try to tackle too many things
at once. Phabricator's
"[Writing Reviewable Code](https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabflavor/article/writing_reviewable_code/)"
provides a set of guidelines that help increase the likelihood of your
pull request getting merged.

In short (slightly modified from the original article):

- A pull request should be as small as possible, but no smaller.
- The smallest a pull request can be is a single cohesive idea: don't
  make pull requests so small that they are meaningless on their own.
- Turn large pull requests into small pull requests by dividing large
  problems into smaller problems and solving the small problems one at
  a time.
- Write sensible pull request descriptions.

Our additions:

- A pull request should affect as few components as possible.


### Submitting a Pull Request

Once you have code that is ready to share, please create a pull request against the GitHub
repo for the MDC platform it corresponds to. See [GitHub's documentation about pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) for more information.

### The small print

Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one above, the
