# About Material Components

The Material Design guidelines contain evolving visual, interactive, and motion
guidance that can be customized to your app and website.

Material Components provide a reliable development environment for apps and
websites across Android, iOS, and the web. Components are updated as the
Material Design system evolves, ensuring consistent pixel-perfect implementation
and adherence to Googleâ€™s front-end development standards, such as
internationalization and accessibility support.

Material Design widgets are also available for
[Flutter](https://flutter.io/widgets/material/), a mobile app SDK for building
high-performance, high-fidelity, apps for iOS and Android, from a single
codebase.
